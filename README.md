# dotfiles
All my configs

# Instructions
## Naming
- To use the above DotFiles, name them as is but with a "." in front
## Path
- Place the files with a "." in front in "~/" directory and the directories such as nvim in "~/.config"
## SymLink
- A better way to handle these is to clone this repo and symlink everything so you always use the updated config from the repo
